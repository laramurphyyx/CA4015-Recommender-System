# CA4015-Recommender-System

## Assignment Details

This project is a joint assignment for the third and fourth assignment of CA4015, worth 50% of the module.

The assignment users recommender system algorithms using the Last.FM dataset to recommend artists.

The assignment follows this [tutorial](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/recommendation) about Collaborative Filter Recommender Systems on the MovieLens dataset. 
In addition to that tutotial, I have also implemented:

    * A Basic Recommender System: A recommender system that will recommend artists based on their ratings/number of listeners
    * A Content-Based Recommender System: A recommender system that will recommend artists based on their tags/name
    * A method to Assign Star-Ratings to Artist: Identifying a suitable way to assign star ratings for each artist from the users


## Repository Layout

* <b>README.md:</b> This markdown file, which outlines the assignment description and deliverables.

* <b>data:</b> The repository which contains a jupyter notebook to import the data directly from [this site](https://grouplens.org/datasets/hetrec-2011/), and cleans them slightly.

* <b>jupyter-book:</b> This repository contains all of the required files to build our jupyter notebook. This is where all of our code, notebooks and markdown files are kept.


## Deliverables

The deliverable for this assignment is the complete jupyter book.
